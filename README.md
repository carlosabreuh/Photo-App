* The photo App is a place where the photo enthusiast can go and search for anything they desire.  The results of the images are in RAW format, and can be expanded to 4K resolution.  

* The app fetures a ♥️ Like button, where the user will have the chance to save the photo to their personal collection, and name that collection to anything they wish to call it. 

* A few issues that surfaced during the making of this app, were the image renderings which some were off the page, but this only appeared to only happen in Chrome browser.  Tested well in Safary and Firefox. 

* Few things that I would like to improve would be:
    - Adding the ♥️ Button to the actual Modal
    - Be able to create multiple collections
    - Be able to also email the photos that were added to the collection
    - Lastly, make sure photos are retained in the user's session for eveytime they login the photos are still available.
